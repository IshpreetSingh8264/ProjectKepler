# API Key Management System

## Overview

ProjectKepler now includes a comprehensive API key management system that allows authenticated users to generate, manage, and use API keys for accessing our services.

## 🔑 Features Implemented

### API Key Generation

- ✅ Secure API key generation using cryptographically secure random values
- ✅ Keys are prefixed with `pk_` for easy identification
- ✅ 32-character random strings for security
- ✅ One-time display with copy functionality

### Security Features

- ✅ API keys are hashed using SHA-256 before storage
- ✅ Original keys are never stored in the database
- ✅ Keys are only shown once to the user
- ✅ Secure verification process for API requests

### User Interface

- ✅ Beautiful API key management dashboard
- ✅ Modal-based key creation flow
- ✅ One-time key display with copy button
- ✅ Key management with usage statistics
- ✅ Responsive design matching ProjectKepler theme

### Database Integration

- ✅ Firestore integration for key storage
- ✅ User association with keys
- ✅ Usage tracking and analytics
- ✅ Key activation/deactivation
- ✅ Secure deletion

## 📁 Files Created

### Core API Key Management

1. `src/lib/apiKeyManagement.ts` - API key CRUD operations
2. `src/components/ApiKeysManager.tsx` - Main management interface
3. `src/components/ApiKeyModal.tsx` - One-time key display modal
4. `src/components/CreateApiKeyModal.tsx` - Key creation modal

### Enhanced Components

1. `src/app/api-docs/page.tsx` - Updated with API key management

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### API Key Structure

```typescript
interface ApiKey {
  id: string; // Firestore document ID
  userId: string; // Associated user ID
  keyName: string; // User-defined name
  hashedKey: string; // SHA-256 hash of the key
  isActive: boolean; // Active status
  createdAt: Date; // Creation timestamp
  lastUsed?: Date; // Last usage timestamp
  usageCount: number; // Total usage count
}
```

### Key Generation Process

1. Generate secure random 32-character string
2. Add `pk_` prefix for identification
3. Hash the key using SHA-256
4. Store hashed version in Firestore
5. Show original key to user once
6. Original key is never stored or retrievable

### Security Model

- **Hash-based verification**: Only hashes are stored
- **One-time display**: Keys are shown only once
- **User association**: Each key is tied to a specific user
- **Activation control**: Keys can be activated/deactivated
- **Usage tracking**: Monitor key usage patterns

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### For Authenticated Users

1. **Access API Management**: Click "Manage API Keys" from API docs
2. **Create New Key**: Click "Create API Key" button
3. **Name the Key**: Provide a descriptive name
4. **Receive Key**: Copy the key from the one-time display modal
5. **Manage Keys**: View, monitor, and delete keys from dashboard

### Key Display Modal Features

- ⚠️ **Security Warning**: Clear message about one-time display
- 📋 **Copy Button**: One-click copy to clipboard
- 📚 **Usage Instructions**: How to use the key in API requests
- ✅ **Confirmation**: User must confirm they've saved the key

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

- Keys are generated using `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- Hashing performed using Web Crypto API
- No keys stored in localStorage or sessionStorage
- Immediate clearing of key from memory after display

### Server-Side Security (Firestore)

- Only hashed keys stored in database
- User-based access control rules
- Automatic usage tracking
- Secure verification process

### API Usage Security

- Keys must be included in Authorization header
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer pk_xxxxxxxxx`
- Verification against hashed database entries
- Usage logging for audit trails

## 📊 Database Schema

### Firestore Collection: `apiKeys`

```javascript
{
  userId: "firebase_user_id",
  keyName: "Production App",
  hashedKey: "sha256_hash_of_key",
  isActive: true,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  lastUsed: Timestamp,
  usageCount: 42
}
```

### Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // API Keys - users can only access their own keys
    match /apiKeys/{keyId} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null
        && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Creating an API Key

```typescript
import { createApiKey } from "@/lib/apiKeyManagement";

const { apiKey, keyId } = await createApiKey(userId, "My App");
console.log(apiKey); // pk_abc123... (show to user once)
```

### Verifying an API Key

```typescript
import { verifyApiKey } from "@/lib/apiKeyManagement";

const result = await verifyApiKey("pk_abc123...");
if (result.isValid) {
  console.log("Valid key for user:", result.userId);
}
```

### Managing User Keys

```typescript
import { getUserApiKeys, deleteApiKey } from "@/lib/apiKeyManagement";

// Get all keys for user
const keys = await getUserApiKeys(userId);

// Delete a specific key
await deleteApiKey(keyId, userId);
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Dashboard Features

- **Empty State**: Friendly empty state when no keys exist
- **Key Cards**: Beautiful cards showing key information
- **Status Indicators**: Visual active/inactive status
