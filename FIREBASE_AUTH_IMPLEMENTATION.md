# Firebase Authentication Implementation

This document explains the Firebase authentication implementation in ProjectKepler.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email/Password Authentication

- **Signup**: Users can create accounts with email and password
- **Login**: Users can sign in with their credentials
- **Email Verification**: Required before users can log in
- **Password Validation**: Minimum 6 characters required

### 2. Google Authentication

- One-click signup/login with Google accounts
- Automatic email verification (Google accounts are pre-verified)

### 3. Security Features

- Email verification mandatory for email/password accounts
- Proper error handling for various authentication scenarios
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Loading states to prevent multiple submissions

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Authentication Files

1. `src/lib/firebaseClient.ts` - Firebase configuration and auth functions
2. `src/lib/authContext.tsx` - React context for authentication state
3. `src/lib/firebaseConfig.ts` - Configuration checker utility
4. `src/components/AuthForm.tsx` - Main authentication component
5. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added AuthProvider wrapper

### Configuration Files

1. `.env.local.example` - Template for environment variables
2. `firebase-packages-install.txt` - Required npm packages

## Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## Installation Steps

1. Install Firebase package:

   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```

2. Set up Firebase project:

   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or use existing one
   - Enable Authentication
   - Enable Email/Password and Google sign-in methods
   - Copy configuration values to `.env.local`

3. Configure Google Authentication:
   - In Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable Google provider
   - Add your domain to authorized domains

## Authentication Flow

### Signup Process

1. User enters email and password
2. Form validates input (email format, password length, password confirmation)
3. Firebase creates user account
4. Verification email is sent automatically
5. User is shown success message and switched to login mode
6. User must verify email before they can log in

### Login Process

1. User enters credentials
2. Firebase attempts authentication
3. System checks if email is verified
4. If verified, user is logged in
5. If not verified, user sees verification message

### Google Authentication

1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Google popup opens for authentication
3. User signs in with Google account
4. Firebase automatically handles the authentication
5. User is immediately logged in (no email verification needed)

## Error Handling

The system handles various Firebase authentication errors:

- `auth/email-already-in-use` - Account exists with this email
- `auth/weak-password` - Password doesn't meet requirements
- `auth/user-not-found` - No account found with this email
- `auth/wrong-password` - Incorrect password
- `auth/invalid-email` - Invalid email format
- `auth/user-disabled` - Account has been disabled
- `auth/popup-closed-by-user` - Google sign-in cancelled
- `auth/popup-blocked` - Browser blocked the popup

## Authentication State Management

The `AuthProvider` component wraps the entire app and provides:

- Current user state
- Loading state during authentication checks
- Automatic authentication state persistence

Components can access authentication state using:

```typescript
import { useAuth } from "@/lib/authContext";

const { user, loading } = useAuth();
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Email Verification**: Users cannot log in until email is verified
2. **Environment Variables**: All Firebase config is stored in environment variables
3. **Client-side Only**: This implementation is client-side only (suitable for most use cases)
4. **Error Messages**: Generic error messages prevent information leakage

## Usage in Components

```typescript
import { useAuth } from "@/lib/authContext";

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  if (user) {
    return <div>Welcome, {user.email}!</div>;
  }

  return <div>Please log in</div>;
}
```

## UI/UX Features

- Smooth animations between login/signup modes
- Loading states on buttons during authentication
- Real-time form validation
- Progressive disclosure (confirm password field appears only when needed)
- Clear error messaging
- Disabled states prevent multiple submissions

## Next Steps

After Firebase packages are installed and environment variables are configured, the authentication system will be fully functional. Users will be able to:

1. Sign up with email/password (with email verification)
2. Log in with verified accounts
3. Sign in with Google (no verification needed)
4. See appropriate error messages for various scenarios
5. Experience smooth UI transitions and loading states
