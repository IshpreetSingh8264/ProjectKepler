# Testing Instructions for ProjectKepler

## üß™ How to Test the Password Animation

1. **Start the Application**
   - Open http://localhost:3001
   - You should see the login form by default with "Welcome back" message

2. **Test the Landing Page**
   - The application should start with the login form (not signup)
   - This is the correct landing page behavior

3. **Test the Animated Confirm Password Field**
   - Click "Don't have an account? Sign up" to switch to signup mode
   - You should see the form change to "Create Account" mode
   - Start typing in the password field
   - **As soon as you type the first character**, the "Confirm Password" field should appear with a smooth animation
   - The animation includes:
     - Smooth height expansion
     - Fade in effect
     - Margin animation for proper spacing

4. **Test Animation States**
   - Clear the password field completely - confirm field should disappear
   - Type again - confirm field should reappear
   - Switch back to login mode - confirm field should disappear immediately

5. **Clear Storage for Fresh Testing**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Type: `localStorage.removeItem('projectKepler_user')`
   - Refresh the page to start fresh

## üéØ Expected Behavior

- **Landing Page**: Always shows login form first
- **Password Animation**: Appears smoothly when typing in signup mode
- **Mode Switching**: Clean transitions between login/signup
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with error animations
- **Dark Theme**: Beautiful gradient backgrounds throughout

## üêõ If Animation Doesn't Work

1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Make sure you're in signup mode (not login mode)
3. Try clearing the browser cache
4. Ensure JavaScript is enabled

The animation uses Framer Motion with cubic-bezier easing for the smoothest possible experience!
